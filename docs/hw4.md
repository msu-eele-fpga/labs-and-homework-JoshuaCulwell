# Homework 4: Timed Counter Program and Test Bench

## Overview
This assignment was to develop a timed counter that takes in a specific amount of time and outputs "done" for a single clock cycle once that amount of time has passed. Along with the timed counter a test bench to test it was needed which cycled through multiple tests to ensure functionality of the timed counter.
